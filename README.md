## 🔧 Workflow Steps


### 1. Signal Intake
Collect, validate and normalize encounter summaries from EHR; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. Discover
Execute discover phase for the Auto-Retrieval pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Retrieve
Execute retrieve phase for the Auto-Retrieval pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Plan Drafting
Plan Drafting across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Documentation
Documentation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Optimization
Optimization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Intervention
Intervention across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 8. Orchestration
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to EHR; return response JSON for the client.
